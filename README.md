Heavily based on the [berry window manager](https://github.com/JLErvin/berry),
with elements from [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) and 
[a Gist](https://gist.github.com/ssokolow/e7c9aae63fb7973e4d64cff969a78ae8) by 
Stephan Sokolow.

Also, much credit to Jasper St. Pierre and his 
[Explanations article series](https://magcius.github.io/xplain/article/) for 
making X a little less confusing.
